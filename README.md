# AutoNotes
A simple website with an integrated TensorFlow convolutional neural network for handwriting classification.

I built this project as an attempt to further my understanding of two areas that are of great interest to me - machine learning and backend development. Throughout this project I had to conquer several challenges that were completely new to me:
 
 - Find an affordable and powerful hosting service
 - Integrate a PostgreSQL database
 - Design and implement a user assignment system for posts
 - Deploy a full project to a hosting site
 - Learn dJango and utilize its capabilities
 - Understand how to use OpenCV to pre-process images

As you can see, I pretty much jumped right into unknown territory with this. I was unfamiliar with practically all of the libraries/frameworks used. In fact, TensorFlow was the only library that I had prior experience in. However, this didn't prevent me from deploying the initial form of this project within two weeks of beginning, although it took countless hours of research and design. In the future, I hope to revisit this and implement a few changes, number one being a more accuracte neural network.

Tensorflow training was implemented using the MNIST 0-9 handwriting dataset, as well as the Kaggle A-Z handwriting dataset. They are available at:
